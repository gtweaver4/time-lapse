# time-lapse
Creates a GUI interface to make time-lapse videos

The simple alogorithm is video_length/desired_length to lengthen
or shorten the clip accordingly.

This makes it easy to turn a 6 minute clip into a 30 second clip.

There is a similar feature in adobe premiere pro that has inspired
this program.
